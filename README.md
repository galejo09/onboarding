# UBC Brain Circuits Cluster Onboarding Portfolio

This onboarding portfolio is intended to introduce new cluster members and neuroscience graduate students to tools and resources that they 
may need as they begin their research at UBC. The portfolio is designed as a quick start guide and is therefore recommended as a reference 
for unfamiliar things that new members may encounter or new skills they may need to acquire.
