The tutorial materials are available on the `NINC GitHub <https://github.com/NINC-UBC/MATLABTutorials>`_. To download,

MATLAB Online
*************

A MathWorks account enables access to MATLAB from a web browser through `MATLAB Online <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html>`_.
Files uploaded into MATLAB Online are stored in `MATLAB Drive <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-drive.html>`_ so you 
can access them upon future log-ins. Note that up to 5GB of storage is 
available in MATLAB Drive.

This platform is convenient for quick access on workstations without MATLAB. 
It is also recommended for sharing and teaching purposes, such as workshops, 
where it would be ideal for all users to have the same and/or latest version of MATLAB.
