Beginner's Guide to Coding: Tips & Tricks

Good practices:
1. Format as you go. 
2. Comment wisely.
3. Short and simple. 
4. Write test cases (figure out when and how your code will fail).
5. Back it up. 

Debugging:
1. Know how to read error messages.
2. Don't just copy from online sources. 
3. Consult the documentation.
4. Diagnose with print statements.
5. Think first, then Google (figure out what you want your code to do then search for the corresponding functions).
	- Check if a function already exists for what you want to do. 
6. Use a debugger (breakpoint() after 3.7, pdb for before).
