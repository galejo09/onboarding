Scholars Portal Dataverse
=========================

`Scholars Portal Dataverse <https://dataverse.org/>`_ is a research data repository that emphasizes discoverability and long-term preservation
of data while ensuring academic credit. For more information, see the section on Scholars Portal Dataverse in the UBC Brain Circuits White Paper.

The Brain Circuits Cluster has its own `dataverse <https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/UBC_BrainCircuits>`_,
within which certain labs have set up their own dataverses.

.. attention::
	The maximum file size for upload on Scholars Portal Dataverse is 2.5 GB.

If a dataverse for your lab already exists, ask your PI for access.

If your lab is interested in creating a dataverse, contact Jeffrey LeDue through email (jledue@mail.ubc.ca).
