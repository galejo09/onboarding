Jupyter Notebook
****************

The `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#>`_ is an open-source web application which
provides an interactive environment that smoothly integrates live code, images, equations, data visualization, interactive
widgets, and text. 

.. note::
	Jupyter is not exclusive to Python - it supports over 40 languages, including R, Java, and MATLAB. IPython is the default kernel
	of Jupyter Notebook but other kernels can be installed to enable the use of other languages within Jupyter.
	
	Check out the list of available kernels `here <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels>`__.
