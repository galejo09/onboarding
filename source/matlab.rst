Installation
************

UBC has a campus-wide MATLAB license hence it is free for students, faculty, staff,
and researchers. 

To install MATLAB, `create a MathWorks account <https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register>`_ with your UBC email,
which automatically links your account with UBC's license. Once you have verified your email address, log into MathWorks.
Your account page should display the license under "My Software". Click the down arrow located in the same row as 
the license to download MATLAB.

For more information on MATLAB installation and troubleshooting, check out `UBC IT's MATLAB page <https://it.ubc.ca/services/desktop-print-services/software-licensing/matlab>`_.

NINC MATLAB Tutorials
=====================

The `NeuroImaging and NeuroComputation Centre (NINC) <https://ninc.centreforbrainhealth.ca/>`__
offers free MATLAB tutorials in Koerner F103. 

The tutorial materials are available on the `NINC GitHub <https://github.com/NINC-UBC/MATLABTutorials>`_. 

If interested in participating in these tutorials, please contact Jeffrey LeDue through email (jledue@mail.ubc.ca).

MATLAB Online
*************

A MathWorks account enables access to MATLAB from a web browser through `MATLAB Online <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html>`_.
Files uploaded into MATLAB Online are stored in `MATLAB Drive <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-drive.html>`_ so they can be 
accessed upon future log-ins. 

.. note::
	5GB of storage is available in MATLAB Drive.

This platform is convenient for quick access on workstations without MATLAB. 
It is also recommended for sharing and teaching purposes, such as workshops, 
where it would be ideal for all users to have the same and/or latest version of MATLAB.
