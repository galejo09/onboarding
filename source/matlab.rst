MATLAB Onramp
=============

`MATLAB Onramp <https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html>`_ is a free, interactive online tutorial offered by MATLAB.

This 2-hour tutorial aims to familiarize new users with the functions and syntax of MATLAB through hands-on excercises with
feedback and hints. 

A MATLAB Onramp Certificate is generated with a percentage indicating progress in the course. 

NINC
====

The `NeuroImaging and NeuroComputation Centre (NINC) <https://ninc.centreforbrainhealth.ca/>`_
offers free MATLAB tutorials three times a year in Koerner F103 on Tuesdays from 1-2 pm. 

The tutorial materials are available on the `NINC GitHub <https://github.com/NINC-UBC/MATLABTutorials>`_. To download, 
click the green button 'Clone or download' then click 'Download Zip'.

If interested in these tutorials, please contact Jeffrey LeDue through email (jledue@mail.ubc.ca). 

*************
MATLAB Online
*************

A MathWorks account enables access to MATLAB from a web browser through `MATLAB Online <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html>`_.
Files uploaded into MATLAB Online are stored in `MATLAB Drive <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-drive.html>`_ so they can be 
accessed upon future log-ins. 

.. note::
	5GB of storage is available in MATLAB Drive.

This platform is convenient for quick access on workstations without MATLAB. 
It is also recommended for sharing and teaching purposes, such as workshops, 
where it would be ideal for all users to have the same and/or latest version of MATLAB.
