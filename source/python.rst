************
Installation
************

Mac OS X and some Linux distributions have Python installed by default.
	
Windows users can download the latest version of Python from the `website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

Once installation is done, click the Python application file again (it should be in the 
Downloads folder as python-<version_number>.exe). A window will pop up. Click on :guilabel:`Modify`
then select :guilabel:`Next`, which leads to :guilabel:`Advanced Options`. Tick the box labeled :guilabel:`Add Python
to environment variables` then click :guilabel:`Install`. Python will now be avaliable in both Command
Prompt and Windows PowerShell. 

To verify installation or to check the version of Python on your system, open a Terminal window (Mac OS X) 
or Command Prompt (Windows) and enter the command below.

.. code-block:: console

		$ python --version

Documentation

Python Standard Library
=======================

The `Python Standard Library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index>`_ contains descriptions 
of built-in functions, constants, types, exceptions, and modules.

PEP 8 
=====

`PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ is the official Python style guide. It outlines Python coding 
conventions to promote readability of code and consistency within and between projects. 

.. tip::

	Adopt good coding habits early. To check that your code is compliant with PEP 8 conventions, run 
	:ref:`pycodestyle<pycodestyle>` on your script.
	
Python Package Index (PyPI)
===========================

The `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_ is a repository of Python packages. 

.. Important::
	``pip`` is the Python package installer program. To install a package,
	enter the command ``pip install <package_name>`` into Terminal or Command Prompt. 
	
The packages listed here form the basis of most data analysis and processing. 

1. IPython
----------

`IPython <https://ipython.org/>`_ is an interactive Python shell. It is best
for exploratory and demonstrative purposes, like quickly testing functions or playing around with 
new commands.

*Documentation*: `<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_

.. admonition:: Example of use

	In a Terminal or Command Prompt window,

	.. image:: /Images/ipython.png
	   :width: 709px
	   :height: 158px
	   :scale: 100 %
	   :alt: x = 5+2 in IPython
	   :align: center

.. tip::
	Try using IPython to go through the examples in this page.
	
2. NumPy 
--------

`NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_ is a library for scientific computation, which includes
support for array and matrix operations, as well as mathematical functions. 

*Documentation*: `NumPy Manual <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html>`_

.. Important::
	To enable the use of NumPy and other packages during a session, it must be *imported*. 
	For ease of use, it is standard for most modules to be imported using an abbreviation. 
	For NumPy, it is typically "np".
	
	.. highlight:: python
	
	::
	
		>>> import numpy as np
		 	 
.. admonition:: Example of use

	Calculate the average potential of a membrane at rest. Suppose the data was stored in
	a variable called potential, which is an array of voltages in units of millivolts. 
	
	.. highlight:: python
	
	::
	
		>>> type(potential) # check that potential is indeed an array
		numpy.ndarray
		>>> mean = np.mean(potential)
		>>> mean
		-70.232
		
.. Note::
	Comments in Python begin with ``#``.
	
3. Matplotlib
-------------

`Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ is a 2D plotting library. The pyplot API `matplotlib.pyplot <https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html#module-matplotlib.pyplot>`_
is a collection of MATLAB-like functions intended for simple plots. 

*Documentation*: `User's Guide <https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html>`_

.. hint:: 

	.. highlight:: python
	
	::
	
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
4. SciPy
--------

`Scipy <https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html>`_ is a library that contains
submodules for integration, interpolation, signal processing, and statistics, among others.

*Documentation*: `<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`_

.. hint::
	
	.. highlight::
	
	::
	
		>>> from scipy import stats
		
5. pandas
---------

`pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is a library that provides tools for
the creation and manipulation of data structures, as well as data analysis. It is 
best for working with tabular data (csv, xlsx) or time series data. 

*Documentation*: `<https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html>`_

.. admonition:: Example of use

	Load in mice.csv and store it in a variable. 
	
	.. highlight:: python
	
	::
	
		>>> import pands as pd
		>>> mice = pd.read_csv('mice.csv')
		>>> mice
		  mouse gender     cage
		0  M802      M  C3M0009
		1  M002      F  C3P0032
		2  M194      F  C3M0009
		
	Store the IDs of female mice in a different variable.
	
	.. highlight
	
	::
	
		>>> female_ID = mice.mouse[mice.gender == 'F']
		>>> female_ID
		1    M002
		2    M194
		Name: mouse, dtype: object
		
6. Seaborn
----------

`Seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html>`_ is a statistical data visualization
library based on matplotlib. It enables easy creation of appealing figures,
like violin plots and heat maps. 

*Documentation*: `<https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html>`_

.. hint::
	
	.. highlight:: python
	
	::
	
		>>> import seaborn as sns
		
.. tip::
	Check out this tutorial from EliteDataScience.com which uses a Pok√©mon dataset to explore the 
	features of seaborn: `The Ultimate Python Seaborn Tutorial: Gotta Catch 'Em All <https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial>`_.

		
7. pycodestyle
--------------

pycodestyle is the Python style guide checker. It was formerly known as pep8.

*Documentation*: `<https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

.. admonition:: Example of use

	Note the use of the ``more`` command to see the contents of example.py. 

	.. highlight:: console
	
	::
		
		$ more example.py
		a="Welcome to the Brain Circuits Cluster!"
		
		print(a)
		
		$ python example.py
		Welcome to the Brain Circuits Cluster!
		
		$ pycodestyle example.py
		example.py:1:2: E225 missing whitespace around operator
		
	A space must be added before and after the equal sign. Modify the script and run it through
	pycodestyle again.
	
	.. highlight:: console
	
	::
	
		$ more example.py
		a = "Welcome to the Brain Circuits Cluster!"
		
		print(a)
		
		$ pycodestyle example.py
		
		$ 
		
	All is well!
